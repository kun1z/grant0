1. Create a new S3 bucket and add 2 folders to it: "boot" and "logs".
2. Upload the files found in /grant0/ along with the runme.sh script found in this folder into the "boot" folder.
3. When creating your EC2 Instances, on "Step 3. Configure Instance" go to the bottom and select "User Data" -> "As file" and select the boot.sh file.
4. Edit the scripts and main.c and change "your_bucket_name" to the bucket name you created.

When your instance(s) boot up, they should automatically update, automatically install GCC, clone your "boot" folder, and run the runme.sh script.
The runme.sh script will compile & run the program, and then upload 1 or more logs depending on success of failure.
